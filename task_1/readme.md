Hey! 
first of all sorry for posting a git link instead of a drive link but 
I figured this should be more convenient for both of us.

Having said that, I hope my codes work the way they should, apologies if they 
do not(they should,but i am afraid i could have missed some corner cases) 
because it has been only 2 weeks since I started working with python.
I would love to hear feedback on codes, provided you have free time.

Happy Testing!
